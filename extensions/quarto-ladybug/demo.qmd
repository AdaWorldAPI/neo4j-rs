# AI War Cloud Graph Queries

This document demonstrates executing Cypher-syntax queries against the aiwar
knowledge graph via ladybug-rs. Each code block posts to the ladybug-rs
`/api/v1/cypher` endpoint and renders results as an interactive table.

## Systems by Military Use

```{ladybug}
MATCH (s:System)
WHERE s.military_use IS NOT NULL
RETURN s.name, s.military_use, s.type
ORDER BY s.name
LIMIT 20
```

## Systems and Their Stakeholders

```{ladybug}
MATCH (s:System)-[:DEVELOPED_BY]->(st:Stakeholder)
RETURN s.name, st.name, s.military_use
ORDER BY s.year
```

## AI Capabilities by Category

```{ladybug}
MATCH (s:System)
WHERE s.capacity IS NOT NULL
RETURN s.capacity AS capability, count(s) AS system_count
ORDER BY system_count DESC
LIMIT 15
```

## Cross-Domain Links (Military / Civilian)

```{ladybug}
MATCH (s:System)
WHERE s.military_use IS NOT NULL AND s.civic_use IS NOT NULL
RETURN s.name, s.military_use, s.civic_use, s.type
ORDER BY s.name
```

## Variable-Length Paths (Supply Chain)

```{ladybug}
MATCH path = (a:System)-[*1..3]->(b:System)
RETURN a.name AS source, b.name AS target, length(path) AS hops
LIMIT 10
```
